# Exercise1
This exercise demonstrates the behaviour of a web browser when a website is accessed using HTTPS and SSL certificate returned by web server is not proper. The SSL certificate will have inappropriate information with respect to one or more of the following three items.
- *Website Name* : The website name returned by certificate is different from that entered by the user.
- *Validity period* : Certificate return by website is already expired or points to a period in the future.
- *Certificate Authority* : The certificate authority that generated the SSL certificate is not known to the web browser.

## Website Name

*_http://webpagetest.org_*, and when web page is displayed, enter the most frequently used
URL e.g. *_acc.digital_*. This will start the test and after few minutes, display the
analyzed results. By default it runs 3 tests, and provides waterfall model of all the
URLs visited, the *Connection View* of TCP connections made, provides analysis of all
requests and responses in *Request Details* along with all HTTP headers.

The description of each of the file here provides this information about acc.digital which
was analyzed on Feb 18, 2018.

- *Waterfall-Model-TestRun1.pdf* : Waterfall models analysis of all the 68 URLs visited for
  the website http://acc.digital
- *Connection-View.pdf*: Details of TCP connections made
- *Exercise01-Request-Details.xlsx* : Timing details of each of the 68 URLs visited, bytes
  downloaded, the start time of first byte download, total download time etc.
- *Ex01-Request-Headers.txt* : Details of HTTP headers (both Request and Response headers)
  of all the 68 URLs.
